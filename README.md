## How to proceed?
- First, design your model in **model.py** file.
- Then, use notebook 2 to train your model.
- Use notebook 3 to test your model along with haar cascades on different faces.

## What to learn?
1. How to transform input data
2. How to design neural network architecture
3. How to train and test your network
4. Pipelining haar cascade algorithm along with your network
5. Some applications of facial keypoints detection (Notebook 4)
